## LMS OAuth Setup (Phase 1)

Create a `.env.local` file with the following (replace placeholders):

```
# App URLs
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME?schema=public"

# Encryption (32-byte key recommended). You can generate one with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=REPLACE_WITH_32_BYTE_BASE64

# Canvas
CANVAS_URL=https://canvas.instructure.com
CANVAS_CLIENT_ID=your_canvas_client_id
CANVAS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_canvas_client_secret

# Moodle (if using local Moodle, adjust URL)
MOODLE_URL=http://localhost:8888/moodle
MOODLE_CLIENT_ID=your_moodle_client_id
MOODLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_moodle_client_secret
```

Then run the database and start the app:

```
pnpm prisma migrate dev
pnpm dev
```
